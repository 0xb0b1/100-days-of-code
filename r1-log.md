# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Paulo Vicente]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 08, Thusday, 2020].

### Day 00: October 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed 90% of the Technical Documentation project. I'm also learning Javascript in parallel.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS flexbox, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.


### Day 01: October 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the responsive project "Technical Documentation page" at @freeCodeCamp, and learnt a bit more of Javascript using EloquentJavascript.

**Thoughts:**: I had hard time messing with flexbox and positioning, but there's a lot to learn.
