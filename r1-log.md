The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 08, Thusday, 2020].

### Day 0: October 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed 90% of the Technical Documentation project. I'm also learning Javascript in parallel.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS flexbox, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.
