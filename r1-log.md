# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Paulo Vicente]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 08, Thusday, 2020].

### Day 0: October 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML and half of CSS part of FreeCodeCamp technical-documentation project [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page].

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS flexbox, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Tomorrow is a new day and I'll try it again.
